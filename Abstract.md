# Abstract

This project conducted an item difficulty analysis by SAS.

Item difficulty is an estimate of the skill level needed to pass an item. It is frequently measured by calculating the proportion of individuals passing an item. For example, in educational field, the item difficulty is simply the percentage of students who answer an item correctly. The item difficulty index ranges from 0 to 100; the higher the value, the easier the question.

The core research question for doing item difficulty analysis is: 
“How appropriate are the difficulty indices of the items comprising the universal standards?” or “How does the discrimination works on analyzing an event?”
The item will have low discrimination if it is so difficult that almost everyone gets it wrong or people simply do it by guesses if we got the pi under 0.3. It could be so easy that almost everyone gets it right if the pi exceeds 0.7. 

In these cases, the event has no impact on the item and it can’t reflect anything.
So, this is the reason for doing item difficulty analysis and keep indices in an appropriate interval (depends on your needs) in order to make them valid. 

In this project, I set the interval be 0.3 to 0.7

Before applying the test, descriptive statistic showed N = 100, mean = 0.65, SD = 0.3, min = 0.01, max = 1

After applying the test, descriptive statistic showed N = 29, mean = 0.51, SD = 0.12, min = 0.3, max = 0.7

29 items were retained within 0.3 and 0.7 interval.

Mean item difficulty of the retained items is closer to the center point of measurement level (0.5) which describes the fittest scenario that items are not too easy or not too difficult, just at the right position.
